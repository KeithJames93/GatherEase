- Party Creation & Sharing: Users can create new party events by providing basic details (name, date, time, location, description). Upon creation, a unique, shareable URL is generated for distributing to guests without needing an account.
- Party Details & Guest RSVP: A dedicated public page for each party where guests can view event details and RSVP by simply providing their name to indicate attendance. This stores guest names associated with their RSVP status.
- Real-time Party Chat: A live, two-way chat interface integrated into each party page, allowing all guests to communicate in real-time. Users participate by entering a temporary display name.
- AI Party Brainstormer: A generative AI tool that assists the party host in brainstorming ideas for themes, activities, or menu suggestions based on simple textual prompts, enhancing party creativity.

## Style Guidelines:

- A light color scheme to convey openness and warmth. The primary color is a lively orange-coral (#FF804D) symbolizing joy and energy, suitable for accents and calls to action.
- The background color is a very light, desaturated orange-pink (#F8F3F0) to maintain a soft and inviting atmosphere, providing subtle branding without distraction.
- The accent color is a rich, deeper rose-magenta (#AF225E), used for highlights, key text, and creating strong visual contrast where needed.
- Both headline and body text will use 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif) for its modern, friendly, and legible appearance, suitable for both short and longer textual content like chat messages.
- Simple, clean, and illustrative icons will be used to represent party-related actions and items (e.g., calendar for date, chat bubble for messages), enhancing clarity and user engagement.
- A responsive, single-page layout for each party, featuring clear sections for event details, RSVP status (summary), and the live chat. Emphasis on ease of access and shareability for guests on any device.
- Subtle, smooth transition animations for elements like chat messages appearing, RSVP status updates, and navigation within the party page, providing a dynamic yet unobtrusive user experience.
